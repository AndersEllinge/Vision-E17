-d = done, -nd = not done, -w = working on

List of required functions to be used:
	Defect analysis based on a histogram -d
	Defect analysis based on the frequency spectrum -d
	Filter design in the frequency domain -nd
	An order statistic filter -nd
	An adaptive filter (we talked about two), an inverse filter or both -nd
