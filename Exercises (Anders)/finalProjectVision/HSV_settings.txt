Should work for both tests.

HSV settings:

int hueMin = 105, saturationMin = 83, valueMin = 42;
int hueMax = 125, saturationMax = 180, valueMax = 115;

segmented = segmentateHSV(image);
segmented = opening(segmented, 0, 3);
segmented = closing(segmented, 0, 3);
segmented = closing(segmented, 0, 3);

segmented = opening(segmented, 0, 14);
